# The Hunt Gamemode

## Description

In this intense and thrilling gamemode, you are the prey.

Each map is a dangerous hunting ground where squads of NPCs, primarily Combine forces, relentlessly search for players. The moment you're spotted, the stakes riseâ€”more Combine reinforcements are dispatched to your location, while the squad that found you will stop at nothing to take you down.

Your ultimate objective is simple yet challenging: eliminate all the Combine without being detected. Stealth, strategy, and precise execution are your best tools for survival.

## To Do List

- [ ] **BUG FIX:** The player is still allowed to respawn when the number of lives is brought down to negative values.
- [ ] **IMPROVEMENT:** Set default player lives to `3` instead of `50`.
- [ ] **IMPROVEMENT:** Set lives reward count for clearing a wave of Combine soldiers to a discrete value such as `1` instead of `1.5`.
